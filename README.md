# Design Patterns â€“ Practice Repository

Welcome to the **Design Patterns Practice Repository**!  
This repository is structured to help developers from different backgrounds (frontend, backend, mobile, etc.) learn and master software design patterns in a hands-on way.

---

## ðŸ“š How This Repository Works

- Each **design pattern** is organized in a **separate Git branch**.
- Inside each branch, youâ€™ll find:
  - ðŸ“‚ `examples/` â€” Real-world and conceptual examples in various programming languages.
  - ðŸ“„ `exercises.md` â€” A list of pattern-specific exercises you need to solve.
  - âœ… Submit your exercise solutions by creating a PR to that patternâ€™s branch.

## ðŸ’¬ Questions & Discussions

If you have any questions or run into issues while working on exercises:
- Ask your question by opening an **issue** or messaging me.
- You can also leave comments in your PRs for specific feedback.
