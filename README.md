# Proxy Design Pattern

## ðŸ§  What is the Proxy Pattern?

The **Proxy Pattern** is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. A proxy can add additional functionality when accessing an object, such as caching, logging, access control, or lazy loading.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Use It?

- **Access Control**: Restrict access based on permissions.
- **Lazy Initialization**: Delay resource-heavy object creation until it's needed.
- **Logging & Auditing**: Track usage or access to sensitive operations.
- **Caching**: Store and reuse expensive or repeated data.
- **Remote Access**: Represent an object in a different address space (e.g., a remote server).

---

## ðŸ§° Where to Use It?

- Virtual proxies for loading large files or images on demand.
- Protection proxies for access control (e.g., admin-only access).
- Caching proxies for repeated API or database calls.
- Logging proxies for monitoring system behavior or audits.
- Remote proxies for invoking operations on remote objects.

---

## ðŸ§© Structure

```
Client --> Proxy --> RealSubject
```

- **Subject**: Interface common to RealSubject and Proxy.
- **RealSubject**: The actual object that does the real work.
- **Proxy**: Controls access and may perform additional tasks.

---

## ðŸ›  How to Implement

1. Define an interface or abstract class (Subject).
2. Implement the RealSubject class with core business logic.
3. Create a Proxy class implementing the same interface.
4. Add extra behavior (e.g., logging, caching) in the Proxy.
5. Let clients use the Proxy instead of directly using RealSubject.

        uses                delegates             does work
```

## ðŸš« When NOT to Use It

- When performance is critical and extra layer causes overhead.
- When added complexity of Proxy is not justified.
- When real object is lightweight and always needed.

| Feature           | Proxy Pattern                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Type              | Structural                     |
| Intent            | Control access to an object    |
| Key Benefit       | Add logic around existing object transparently |
| Common Uses       | Security, Logging, Caching, Lazy Load |

## ðŸ§  Related Patterns

- **Decorator**: Adds behavior without controlling access.
- **Adapter**: Converts one interface to another.
- **Facade**: Simplifies a subsystem, doesn't control a single object.---

## ðŸ“¦ Example (Generic Pseudocode)

### Scenario: Lazy Loading a Large Document

```
interface Document {
    display()
}

class RealDocument implements Document {
    constructor(filename) {
        loadFromDisk(filename)
    }

    display() {
        print("Displaying document: " + filename)
    }
}

class ProxyDocument implements Document {
    constructor(filename) {
        this.filename = filename
        this.realDocument = null
    }

    display() {
        if (this.realDocument == null) {
            this.realDocument = new RealDocument(this.filename)
        }
        this.realDocument.display()
    }
}

// Client code
doc = new ProxyDocument("contract.pdf")
doc.display()  // Loads and displays
doc.display()  // Only displays (no loading)
```

**Explanation**: `ProxyDocument` delays loading of `RealDocument` until `display()` is called, saving resources if the document is never viewed.
